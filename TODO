do rest of Chapter 2 Parsing exercises, once we have output instead of just recognition
-#4 - parseNumber with different bases
-#5 - character literals
-#6 - floats/decimals
-#7 - full Scheme numeric tower ()

Chapter 2 Recursive Parsing exercises
-#1 - backquoting
-#2 - vectors (after implementing set!)
-#3 - left-factor grammar so common part of list/dotted list is its own parser
